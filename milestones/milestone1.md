## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We collaborated on Slack, dividing tasks and feature planning. What went well was team members offering their thoughts on solutions to progress through our to-do items.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One challenge our group faced was finding times when everyone was available to meet and collaborate effectively. Coordinating across different schedules sometimes delayed our progress. Also discussing and assigning roles to ensure each member worked in their area of strength for the best results as we are still learning about each other.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

For upcoming units, we'll need  support with time management and creating early checklists to stay organized. Having clear timelines and milestone reminders would help our group stay on track. This structure will make it easier to complete each project element efficiently and avoid last-minute stress.
