## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Last week’s presentation provided strong motivation to complete this week’s assignment with more focus and confidence. Having our core ideas and wireframes finalized early made the UI development steps feel more structured and manageable. This helped the team move through tasks efficiently and stay aligned on our visual goals.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One of the main challenges was getting everyone consistently involved in completing their assigned tasks. Coordinating schedules and ensuring each member contributed equally required extra communication. However, using GitHub’s project space this week helped improve our task tracking and accountability.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?
We completed most of the tasks outlined in our sprint plan, though we are still adjusting to using GitHub Projects for sprint management. The remaining items will be prioritized by dependency and importance, focusing first on essential development work before addressing refinements. As the team becomes more comfortable with the new system, we expect smoother collaboration.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The main features currently at risk are the integrations between our web app and the Render deployment environment. Hosting, connectivity, and ensuring all services work seamlessly together have been challenging. If these issues persist, we’ll allocate additional time for testing and debugging before adding new functionality.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We would benefit from additional guidance to ensure our project fully meets CodePath’s specifications and grading criteria. Clearer rubrics and examples of high-scoring submissions would help us better understand expectations. This support would help us refine both technical quality and presentation standards.
